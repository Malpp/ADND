# ADND Random roller

How these randoms are rolled is you continually enter a room. It uses the randoms table to determine what's inside the room.

currently, the DB only contains level 1 of randoms.

Plans:

1. Make it roll magic items/gems
2. Add more levels to the DB
3. Add some type of GUI with a loot aquired table
